Project-Proposals
=================

For my data projects, I propose juicing, exotic pet vet visit and rollercoasters and water rides.

<h2>Juicing NYC</h2>
Celebrity-endorsed juicing has taken New York by the storm, since New York Times announced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/dining/the-rush-toward-cold-pressed-juices.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&">The Juice-Bar Brawl</a>" in April 2013, Organic Avenue has increased its locations from nine to ten and Juice Press has increased its locations from nine to 19. 

In addition to what has been reported, I am interested to find out the following:
1.	Where are juice bars located in New York? Is there a particular borough where juice bars concentrate? 
2.	Cost per bottle 
3.	What is the top selling juice? Its ingredients?

On top of the aforementioned chains, I am also interested in looking into include Blossom du Jour (three locations), Gingersnap’s Organic (three locations), Liquiteria (5 locations), Juice Generation (12 locations) and Terri (two locations). To be included, a juice bar needs to be started and based in New York, offers cleanse products or cold pressed juices and has products that bear its names. 
 
The project will provide a deeper look into a so-called trend. I would like to present my story in blog-like format, starting with where juice bars are located. Locations will be presented as colored dots scattered across a map of New York. The color of will coordinate with each shop, for example Juice Generation will be blue and Organic Avenue will be red. I also want to present info graphic of three of the most popular juice and its ingredients, contrasting the cost of raw ingredient versus a bottle of juice.  

Furthermore, by acquiring these data, I can examine whether or not the juicing trend is truly “green.” For example, are we favoring one type or certain type of vegetables over others? What effects does the demand have on agriculture and ecosystem at large? What about over consumption and juice-bottle produced waste?  

To get the necessary data, I will have to scrap and clean up shop location addresses from individual websites, merge and organize them into excel file and learn to plot colored dots on a map. I think it might be easier if I scrap off store locations using Google map, which ensures standardized format. I will also have to call up each store to find out its top-selling juice and possibly, juicing ingredients.

There are a number of places I can see this infographic be showcased, like Wired, Modern Farmer and New York Magazine. 


<h2>Exotic Pets</h2>
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average veterinarian salaries for job postings in New York in 2013 are $92,000, which is 17% higher than average veterinarian salaries for job postings nationwide.  With growing demands in pet care-related services – estimated to reach $58.51 billion in 2014 (<a href="http://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp">in 2013, actual spending in pet industry expenditures reached $55.72 billion</a>), I would like to explore the under-reported world of exotic pet care in New York by concentrating on New York-based clinics with “Avian & Exotic Pet Care” unit. Using data gathered from MyVeterinarian.com, facilities that I will reach out to include Animal Medical Center, Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine, St. Marks Veterinary Hospital and The Humane Society of New York, to name a few. 

New York has outlawed owning exotic pets state-wide, so exotic pets will be limited to birds, guinea pigs, turtle, reptiles, rodents and others.

I hope to gain access to collect the following data:
1.	Number of exotic pets that visited the clinic in 2013, as opposed to traditional pets like dogs and cats
2.	Available treatment and cost
3.	What was the most common injury in each exotic pet category? How was the injury treated? Cost?  
4.	Compare and contrast cost, is it more expensive to treat one kind of pet over another? 

In a city like New York where it has a reputation of being expensive, what does it take to take care of exotic pets? 

I want to present the information as a slideshow (I will have to learn how to make these). The first slide will show pictures, more like shadowed outlines, of pets and how many visited the vet in 2013. As you click through the slide, you can read about the cost of treating each type of exotic animals. The ending slides will include the most bizarre or expensive treatment each facility encountered. 

To accomplish my project I will have to contact individual facilities to get the necessary data. Additionally, I will have to use Illustrator to create vector images.

I see my work getting picked up by Huffington Post, Buzzfeed and the Cut (sites that aggregate and emphasize on social traffics). 

 
<h2>Rollercoasters & Water Rides</h2> 
When it comes to rollercoasters and water parks, my home state California boast of Ranging Waters, Six Flags and Disneyland, to name a few. I would like to plot amusement parks – limiting them to large amusement parks, theme parks and water parks, in the United States. Theme parks come with characters and usually have a “theme,” like Disney; in contrast, amusement parks focus more on its rides, sporting higher, faster and crazier rollercoasters.  

Using <a href="http://www.iaapa.org/find-an-attraction">IAAPA directory</a> (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) I will scrap data for parks in each state and sort the information in Excel. I will also be compiling information about the top five tallest, fastest and longest rollercoasters. 

Amusement parks exist to meet demands. I think the end result will reveal a lot about each state. For example, Alaska has no amusement parks or theme parks or water parks (makes sense, considering its climate) and Alabama, out of six parks that fit my criteria, has five water parks.  

In addition to getting my data off IAAPA, I will most likely have to go to each park’s website to find out what’s unique about it. I want to focus primarily on what each state has to offer in terms of park entertainment.

Parks will be plotted by color, blue for water parks, purple for amusement parks and dark grey for theme parks. A list of parks, divided by states, will be listed below. 

I can see myself pitching this to Buzzfeed, ParkWorld Online, RollerCoaster!, CNN, USA Today and any other news organization.
